I am in the business of making it work and having people use it, not someone taking my glory, see "License", companies may link with object files produced from the Software, (You) can go dilate somewhere else.

# License
Definitions:
'Software' is any document distributed along this License
'Plausibly alterated' stands to mean any document that may be be used to re-generate the Software through a computer program employing the reverse logic
of the one that generated the document, meaning that all manner off transpilation into new "source code" that would have otherwise been exempt from this License is not allowed under the terms of this License.

You may distribute the non-Plausibly alterated products of the Software such as runnable binaries, possibly for a fee
but not distribute the Software or its Plausibly alterated products, which include object files.
You may run products of the Software.

This License will be applied to the full extent of American law.
