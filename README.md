# Best-kernel
better than even loonix.

# Updates
may take anywhere between a day and weeks depending on what it is I have implemented
Some of the code might seem like nonsense and if that is the case I can assure you that I have a note for it, ergo: "why are mutexes not being used anywhere???"

# Contributing
the kernel is a solo project but device drivers (maybe even userspace applications???) are welcome
